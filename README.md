## Intro ðŸ“–
HTML or HyperText Markup Language, is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content and CSS or Cascading Style Sheets describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. Web pages that we use every day in the browser are created with both. We define the meaning, structure and style of web content through these technologies.
In this project HTML and CSS were used to build a Google clone.

## What did I build? ðŸ–‡
The project is focused on building the google interface, especially its UI/UX to partially replicate its behaviour and style. The interface is divided into the following sections:

* Header: Section where the main Google navigation is located.

* Main: Container section for the central and most important elements of the interface.

* Footer: Section containing extra information for the user.

## Project objective ðŸŽ¯
Learn how to use HTML5 tags and CSS3 properties, as well as identify core components of a website, to analyse and replicate them using basic components.
